    "comment": "The opposition to these props is not coming from blind distrust. It could be argued that the PR campaign paid for by SSE is dishonest for a few reasons.  Big arenas / stadiums like this never generate meaningful revitalization or net gain in economic activity, yet that’s one of the main selling points... ‘Good jobs’ is a dubious claim. What exactly are the net new jobs from this project? The Spurs and SSE are already here, no new jobs there. So, likely just the temporary construction jobs."

    "label": "pro",
    "comment": "They can’t afford to, the billionaires who are part of ownership own minority stakes of the team, not anything near majority stakes and they aren’t funding an arena as minority owners.  Edit: To add, the minority owners should also not be expected to pay for a stadium outright. Companies I own minority stakes or fractional shares in do not send me a bill when they want to open up a new office building."

The vote today on Prop B is only pertaining to the County's contribution of $311M or 25% of the cost of the arena, whichever one is lower... This is a non-binding agreement so anything can be renegotiated..."

    "comment": "I’m typically an anti-public-funding for stadiums guy, at least to start because every case is different. But this is a lot more than a stadium deal.  ...Playing chicken with the Spurs on funding a new arena is a terrible idea... If the Props pass, the Spurs will likely never even think about leaving. Voting “no” is a vote of confidence in both the Spurs and ourselves."

    "comment": "while this is one of the few takes I concede makes sense to me, i don't think that the benefit of redevelopment inherently requires a Spurs arena... and while that deal sounds great, we are still talking about 2/3rds of the base cost being taxpayer money. that's hundreds of million at risk... i just do not care if the spurs leave."

    "comment": "People keep saying locals won’t be footing the bill for this but you don’t think ticket prices will increase? You don’t think SAWS bills will increase when they have to pay millions to move their cooling plant? What about all the infrastructure improvements we will likely need that this bill doesn’t cover?  Ask Buffalo Bills season ticket holders that are seeing ticket prices raise thousands of dollars if they think their new stadium is helping stimulate the local economy."

I have a wild suspicion that there are plenty of locals using the hotels so we will absolutely be footing the bill through increased costs. I've rented a car and used the local hotels far more often than I've benefited from spurs games or a stupid baseball stadium"

Imagine when Cleveland had LeBron if they said “well you know we have this generational talent that will pay for himself, but…”"

    "comment": "I voted yes for the project. The city has for far too long held onto this small city mentality and allowed its self to play 2nd fiddle to Houston, Dallas, and Austin. The taxes that will pay for a portion of the project is coming from tourist, not local citizens. The Spurs are also pitching in a ton of money as well..."

    "comment": "The problem is that has been proven 3 times that large sports complexes don’t do well in SA... The problem is the tax dollars being used for a business that won’t be sharing that profit with the city. The only expectation for the city is the famous trickle down economics that haven’t ever worked."
